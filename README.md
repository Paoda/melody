# Melodii Music Player
### An Electron Based Music Player


## Why Was Melodii Music Player Made?
MMP was created as a long term project to introduce me to electron and more complicated programming in general. 
Before this project I had worked on small projects that never took more than an hour. After seing a friend create a videogame
in Java, I felt the need to challenge myself as well...

## Goals
I wish to have a Operational Music Player that can achieve a couple of things:
* Good Looking Flat UI
* Ability to Play at the bare minimum: FLAC and MP3.
* Ability to read a directory chosen by user and scan said directory for Music
* Play, Pause, Go Back 30s, Skip Forward and Backwards Controls
* Progress Bar thing that allows you to go back and forward in a song.
* Total song Time & current song time e.g. 3:20/6:23
* Display Albums with Album Covers 
* Have Album Cover in general

Damn This is very ambitous for a beginner like me...
